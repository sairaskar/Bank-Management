I have created a project with the help of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, such as inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism, and encapsulation.


Project Technical Details:

Java Technology:

Utilizes Java as the primary programming language
Leverages strong typing and platform independence
Implements robust error handling and exception management


Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) Principles:

Encapsulation: Private members with controlled access
Inheritance: Potential for creating specialized account types
Polymorphism: Multiple method implementations
Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details


MySQL Database Integration:

Uses MySQL for persistent data storage
Supports multiple account types and transactions
Provides scalable and reliable data management

JDBC Framework Capabilities:

Establishes database connections
Executes prepared statements
Manages database transactions
Handles SQL operations securely



Key Features Demonstrated:

Database connectivity
Account management
Transaction processing
Object-oriented design patterns

The project showcases a comprehensive approach to building a bank management system, integrating multiple technologies to create a robust and scalable application.
